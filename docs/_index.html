    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate programming</a> is a programming paradigm
    introduced by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language,
    such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source
    code can be generated. The approach is used in scientific computing and in data science routinely for reproducible
    research and open access purposes. Literate programming tools are used by millions of programmers today.
